# reeborg-staging

**Important**: do not file issues or create forks or pull requests for this repository. You should go instead to the main repository: https://github.com/aroberge/reeborg

This repository is for staging and testing Reeborg's World prior to deployment of updates to main sites. It acts as a live development version for testing, thanks to Github and the magic of Github Pages.  Please do not abuse this site, and go instead to http://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html

This site is created by running update.py which copies the required files from the main repository (reeborg), reconstructing the required directory structure. This assumes that the main reeborg repository is locally at the same directory level as this repository.

At present, not all files are recopied as some soon-to-be obsolete files are skipped over.

The  live version can be found at https://aroberge.github.io/reeborg-staging/
